# OF-box
files for a collapsible acrylic open field box:
These files contain designs for a collapsible open field box with dimensions 45 cm length x 45 cm width x 35 cm height and 6 mm thickness. This open field box is designed to be used for mouse behavioral paradigms. It is collapsible for easy storage and movement. The box is composed of 4 pieces of the file "OF-box-side" and 1 piece of the file "OF-box-bottom" for a total of 5 pieces. The four side pieces connect via hooks and holes on their edges, and these four pieces then slide into the bottom piece. The file "construction-directions" contains visual instructions for putting together the 5 piece open field box. This design was made to be cut from acrylic, but can be altered for any other material provided tolerance is taken into account. Please see the files "completed-box" 1 and 2 for photos of our clear acrylic box put together. Happy roaming!
